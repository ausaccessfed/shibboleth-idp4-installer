# can be left unset. If usent, the entity ID will be created based on the HOST_NAME
# value below.
#ENTITY_ID=https://idp.example.edu/idp/shibboleth

#  Specify the externally facing address for this IdP. Typically you would have
#  a DNS entry for this. Do *NOT* use 'localhost' or any other local address.

#  The attribute used for AuEduPersonSharedToken, eduPersonTargetedId and
#  the persistent Name ID value generation.
#
#  IMPORTANT: The generation of AuEduPersonSharedToken and EduPersonTargetedId
#  require the value from the specified source attribute. If the value changes,
#  it will change the AuEduPersonSharedToken and EduPersonTargetedId. This will
#  cause the user to lose access in the federation. It is *critical* that you
#  specify an attribute that will never change.
#
# Generally use uid for most LDAP servers and sAMAccountName for MS Active
# Directoy. In some situations the directory will use cn (commonName) to hold
# the users unique login name.
#
# The attribute choose MUST provide a unique single value for ALL user. If
# this is not the case no value will be provide for the auEduPersonSharedToken.
#
#SOURCE_ATTRIBUTE_ID=uid

# The attribute used to generate the subject ID and pairwise ID attributes.
# These are new attributes values that will eventually replace eduPersonTargetedID
# and may replace auEduPersonSharedToken.
#
# These attributes will be crated on the fly and based on the persisten attribute 
# that MUST have the following properties:
#    * Persistent - NEVER changes once assigned to a user
#    * Non-reassignable  - Is NEVER reassigned to another user
# If your Identity system does not currently have such an attribute provided for
# each user you MUST leave the following value blank. 
#
# WARNING: Once you have assigned a value, you can NOT change it. If it does change
#          all of your user's identities will change!
#
#PERSISTENT_ATTRIBUTE_ID=

# Perform a system update as part of the bootstrap and every time you run
# the update-idp script to ensure all of your operating system software is
# patched and up to date. Setting this value to "true" is recommended.
# Valid values are either "true" or "false".

# Select the local Firewall that will be running on your server. The default
# is firewalld which is the default for CentOS and RHEL 7. Some organisations
# have selected to maintain iptables. You can also select to not have the
# installer maintain your local firewall but this is definitly NOT recommeded.
# Relevant values are:
#    firewalld (default)
#       Adds ports 433 (https) and 8443 (IdP backchannel) ports to the
#       firewalld config. All other configuration remains unchanged.
#    iptables
#       Adds ports 22 (ssh), 443 (https) and 8443 (IdP backchannel) ports
#       to the iptables config. Other firewall settings may be overwritten!
#    none
#       You are responsible for the maintance of the servers firewall. No

# The Shibboleth IdP can provide a back channel for Service Providers to
# communicate directly with the Identity Provider. This has been used for
# attribute release, transmission of messages via SAML Artifact and more recently
# for backchannel SLO. The AAF have idenified that none of the use cases for
# the backchannel are relivant to operation within the AAF, and therefor
# recommend it no longer be enable be default. If it is required, for example
# for a standalone Attribute Authority service, then setting the following to true
# will enable configuration for the backchannel.

ENABLE_BACKCHANNEL=false


#

# Enable your IdP to participate in eduGAIN (https://aaf.edu.au/edugain/). Your
# orgainisation must be enable at the federation before being enabled to use
# eduGAIN services. Setting the following values to true will only technically
# enable your IdP. You MUST complete the steps described AAF eduGAIN web site in
# addition to making the technical changes.
